Of course. Here is a comprehensive `README.md` file for a project named **lavlashfee**, based on the technologies and concepts you provided.

This README assumes a "monorepo" structure, where the Dlang backend, Dart client, and React web app all live within the same top-level project directory. The fictional "Wines Gape Script" is interpreted as a custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for the project.

## Project Overview

The `lavlashfee` project aims to provide an all-in-one solution for oenophiles and sommeliers. It goes beyond simple inventory management by introducing a powerful scripting engine called **Wines Gape Script (WGS)**. Users can define complex rules, tasting profiles, and cellar automation logic using this simple, declarative language.

The system is composed of three main parts:
*   **The Server**: A robust API server built with **Dlang** for maximum performance and efficiency. It handles business logic, database interactions, and executes WGS scripts.
*   **The Web Client**: A feature-rich web application built with **React** for managing the wine cellar from any modern browser.
*   **The Mobile/Desktop App**: A cross-platform client built with **Dart (Flutter)** that provides on-the-go access to your collection and notifications.

## Architecture

The project follows a modern client-server architecture. All clients communicate with the central Dlang server via a RESTful or GraphQL API.

## Key Features

*   **Multi-Platform Access**: Manage your collection via Web, iOS, Android, and Desktop.
*   **High-Performance Backend**: Dlang server ensures fast response times and low resource usage.
*   **Powerful Automation**: Use **Wines Gape Script (WGS)** to define rules for aging, serving recommendations, and re-stock alerts.
*   **Rich Data Visualization**: Analyze your collection's value, composition, and tasting history with interactive charts.
*   **Client-Side Development**: A clear separation between the Dlang server and the Dart/React clients.

## Technology Stack

*   **Server (Backend)**:
    *   [**Dlang**](https://dlang.org/): The core language for the API server, chosen for its performance, safety, and modern features.
    *   [**Vibe.d**](https://vibed.org/) (or [**Hunt Framework**](https://github.com/huntlabs/hunt-framework)): Asynchronous I/O web framework for building the API.
*   **Web Client (Frontend)**:
    *   [**React**](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
    *   [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): For type safety and scalability.
    *   [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/): Next-generation frontend tooling for a fast development experience.
*   **App Client (Mobile/Desktop)**:
    *   [**Dart**](https://dart.dev/): The language used for client-side application development.
    *   [**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev/): Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
*   **Scripting**:
    *   **Wines Gape Script (WGS)**: A custom, domain-specific language (DSL) for defining wine-related logic. The parser and interpreter are built in Dlang.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Dlang (dmd) & Dub](https://dlang.org/download.html)
*   [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/)
*   [Dart & Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
*   A running instance of PostgreSQL.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/lavlashfee.git
    cd lavlashfee
    ```

2.  **Setup the Server (Dlang):**
    ```bash
    cd server
    dub upgrade
    # Configure your database connection in a config file (e.g., config.ini)
    ```

3.  **Setup the Web Client (React):**
    ```bash
    cd ../client-web
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Setup the App Client (Dart/Flutter):**
    ```bash
    cd ../client-app
    flutter pub get
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need to run each part of the project in a separate terminal.

1.  **Start the Dlang Server:**
    ```bash
    # In the ./server/ directory
    dub run
    # The server will start, typically on http://localhost:8080
    ```

2.  **Start the React Web Client (Dev Mode):**
    ```bash
    # In the ./client-web/ directory
    npm run dev
    # The web app will be available at http://localhost:5173
    ```

3.  **Start the Dart/Flutter App Client:**
    ```bash
    # In the ./client-app/ directory
    # Select your target device (e.g., Chrome, iOS Simulator, Android Emulator)
    flutter run
    ```

## The "Wines Gape Script" (WGS)

**Wines Gape Script (WGS)** is a simple, declarative DSL designed to empower users. It allows you to define rules and metadata for your wine collection in a human-readable format. These scripts are parsed and executed by the Dlang server.

**Example `cellar_rules.wgs`:**

```wgs
// Define a specific vintage
VINTAGE "Château Margaux 2015" {
    ID: 101;
    REGION: "Bordeaux", "Margaux";
    RATING: 100;
    PEAK_DRINKING: 2025-2060;

    // Define an automated action
    ACTION on_stock < 3 {
        ALERT("Low stock on Margaux 2015!", URGENT);
        NOTIFY(sommelier@example.com);
    }
}

// Define a general rule for a grape
GRAPE "Pinot Noir" {
    SERVING_TEMP: 14C;

    // A rule that applies to all Pinot Noir wines
    RULE if age > 10y {
        RECOMMEND("Decant for 60 minutes before serving.");
    }
}
```
