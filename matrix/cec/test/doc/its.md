hey guys! with the update drawing closer, id like to explain some things, and clear up some misconceptions.

## Why pick something unpopular for 6.0?
We know its what partly caused the update to flop, so ill say two things immediately:
1. we wont do anything like this for a while again
2. we picked GG for update 6.0 because it fit the pvp theme. simple as that!
no other anime or game wouldve fit as best, or wouldve been nearly as recognizable. despite not many having actually played GG, a lot of people either 1) recognize characters like bridget or jack-O, or 2) think the characters look cool and interesting. all our updates always revolve around a theme, and this was the case for the 6.0 “pvp” update as well. GG fit this theme the best, so we picked it.
And, besides -- my opinion is GG itself wasnt the issue. 6.0 was really buggy on release, which soured a lot of people's first impressions.

## Why is the game so buggy?
This is something we take very seriously. The short answer: we kept adding so many new gamemodes, passives, and abilities, that we had to keep rewriting the games code from the ground up to support it all.
PVP was the hardest by far—before, a global skill cooldown just meant it can be used once. but in PVP, it could be used by both players at once despite being “global", and required rewriting to support it. a lot of boss mechanics that stunned or debuffed, units that buffed allies, and many others all required rewriting. it was a huge undertaking, and inevitably caused bugs that both devs and testers missed out on from the sheer quantity!
And because we have a small dev team with only a few programmers, we had to prioritize adding new units and content instead of fixing bugs—bugs are bad, but if we didnt update, the game would die!

**The good news**: we wont be adding any huge new gamemodes for a long while. This means less bugs caused, and also more time to fix existing bugs. **We’ve fixed** **__300 bugs in the past two weeks alone.__** We still have 120 reported bugs on our tracker, with many more being reported every day—our goal is to fix as many as we can!

We’re currently in code-freeze, which means no changes are being made to the live game. This is because Update 6.5 is almost ready, and so we are working in a separate test-only place. This means that no bug fixes have been made, and instead they’ve been added in that testing place instead. The Update 6.5 update log already has **2 full pages of nothing but bug fixes**!
